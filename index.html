      <h2>The House - Using Fantasy to Show Reality</h2>
    </hgroup> 

    <article>
      <p>The world has been shocked by the long-awaited release of the Epstein files, which have exposed several billionaires and people in positions of power, such as grooming pedophiles and cannibals. The reality described in the emails, pictures, videos, and conversation transcripts found in these files released by the United States Department of Justice is nothing short of horrific. Considering the latest news regarding the release of the Epstein files and the exposition of his human trafficking, sex trafficking, and child sexual abuse ring, it is easy to forget about the individual victims. I have decided to bring the spotlight to two sisters, Annie and Maria Farmer, who were both groomed and assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Their testimony describes the systemic process through which Epstein and Maxwell were able to claim so many victims.</p>

      <p>In her interview with Meghna Chakrabarti, Annie Farmer explains that her older sister, Maria, who was a talented aspiring artist, had already met Epstein. He had lured her by giving her massive opportunities to expose her art and giving her a job providing art for them. During her time working for them, she would talk to her younger sister Annie, who was a 16-year-old girl with big academic dreams but unsure about being able to fund them. At that point, Epstein just looked like a good Samaritan who felt joy in helping promising young people achieve their goals. Annie says in the interview that, in hindsight, that was the vulnerability that Epstein exploited, and that he was “just a master at recognizing vulnerabilities. By the time Maria realized who Epstein was, Annie was already on a private island with Epstein and Maxwell being groped, assaulted, and abused, while there was nothing she could do to help.</p>

      <p>The House is a fantasy role-playing game where you play as Aerie, a young, promising adventurer in a guild who gets invited by Mr. Sestein – the Guild’s top donor – to discuss business and thank her for her good work. Lexy is her younger sister and an aspiring adventurer. She wishes to follow in the footsteps of her older sister. Aerie sees her summoning as a good opportunity for Lexy to get off to a great start in her career with a strong connection. Once they get to the House, they are welcomed by Mr. Sestein and his partner, Miss. J. Grey, who both look a bit too eager to meet them. Mr. Sestein’s interest shifts from Aerie to Lexy as Miss J. Grey gives them food laced with sleeping agents. Aerie wakes up in a holding cell alone with one other prisoner and realizes what’s going on. She manages to escape, but she has a promise to keep. The player will have to go through the House and fight anyone in her path to save her sister. </p>

      <p>The game concept is heavily inspired by Undertale, an indie game developed by Toby Fox, in which you play as a human who has fallen into the world of monsters. As a human, you are naturally much more powerful than monsters but fighting remains optional. The player's actions determine whether they receive a good, bad, or neutral ending. Similarly, my game will feature multiple endings based on player decisions, but its primary sources of inspiration are the game's art style, fight mechanics, and structure. I will also have my own original soundtracks and I plan on having all assets be drawn by me.</p>

      <p>Art is often used to share the artist’s emotions and experiences. It can make people feel and understand the artists’ world. I will use video games to help players feel how disturbing the sister’s situation is. The script follows the grooming process described by Annie and Maria Farmer but set in a fantasy world where there is hope, and they can fight back. The game must be far enough from reality to spark wonder and excitement, but close enough to deliver a real shock when the truth becomes clear.
